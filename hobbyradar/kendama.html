            <h2>What is kendama?</h2>
            <p>
                Kendama is a toy that many have seen or heard of but not nearly as many people have tried out. 
                A simple ball-and-cup toy at first, over time the kendama has been tweaked to become yet another 
                skill toy for beginners and enthusiasts alike to practice coordination and patience. Kendama 
                enthusiasts now juggle, throw, spin, and precisely balance the ball and the ‘cup’ parts of 
                the toy (called the ken) in all sorts of interesting and challenging ways. This hobby starts 
                out simple and can become as easy or hard as you want.

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Kendama is an extremely accessible hobby! Kendamas are fairly cheap (starting around $20-25 for 
                a decently nice one) and can last quite a long time, be dropped many times, etc. without needing to 
                be replaced. It’s not dangerous or particularly tiring, but requires patience with yourself. It 
                definitely takes time to master the hand-eye coordination to get the tricks you are working on to be 
                consistent. Kendama is also a hobby you can pretty much take anywhere and isn’t too hard to just pick 
                up to quell a few minutes of boredom between other activities. Playing kendama for a long period of 
                time will really help your hand-eye coordination and make you feel like you have a real aptitude for 
                catching things and other activities with quick reaction times.

            <h2>Experience and Communities</h2>
            <p>
                    I’ve been flipping balisongs since I was around 14 or so. 
                    Though there are far better flippers than me out there I’m 
                    happy where I’m at, and still enjoy learning new tricks every so often.
                    There are some really solid smaller communities for balisong. A couple 
                    facebook groups and subreddit as well as several smaller community sites 
                    produce a fairly close-knit community when it comes to dedicated flippers. 
                    Instagram is another available social media platform for balisong.

            <h2>What is origami?</h2>
            <p>
                Origami is the ancient art of paper folding to create interesting new shapes and ideas. 
                Thought to originate anciently from either China or Japan, Origami has both deep 
                historical roots and impressive modern applications and advancements. Models range from 
                pleasantly simple to mind-boggling and complex which provides an impressive range in 
                which attracted hobbyists can begin learning. Simple models especially can be found as 
                diagrams and instructions that can be followed at one’s leisure and own pace.

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Origami has a very low barrier to entry. It’s very very cheap as well! The only thing 
                you need to physically obtain is paper. Many books and videos are available online and 
                at public libraries to help you move from beginner to advanced models. Origami can be 
                done anywhere, anytime, and can be interrupted at pretty much any point in the folding 
                process for you to go do important things or take whatever breaks you need.

            <div>
                <p>
                    I became fascinated by origami as a child around 8 or 9 years old and have phased in 
                    and out of passion for it ever since. It’s always a fun hobby to come back to, and if 
                    you fold some models enough you can pull them out as a cool party trick or a small gift 
                    for someone on short notice.

                    There are some awesome communities for origamists including local clubs, a couple of 
                    facebook pages and subreddits, tags on instagram and a plethora of websites with detailed 
                    instructions from beginner to very advanced models.

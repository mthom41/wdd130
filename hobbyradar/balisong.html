            <h2>What is a Balisong?</h2>
            <p>
                Balisong is actually the name of a tool more commonly known as a butterfly knife. 
                Cited often as appearing originally in the Philippines and occasionally cited as 
                originating in France, the balisong is a knife with 2 handles that enclose the 
                blade when shut and hold it straight when open. Itâ€™s a very useful tool that can 
                be both opened and shut with 1 hand making it very convenient to work with. In modern 
                day, balisongs are used primarily as a sort of skill or stunt toy, with the primary 
                goal being to spin the knife around in interesting and complex ways. Mastery of momentum 
                and finger control is a large part of this hobby.

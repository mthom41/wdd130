            <h2>What is a Balisong?</h2>
            <p>
                Balisong is actually the name of a tool more commonly known as a butterfly knife. 
                Cited often as appearing originally in the Philippines and occasionally cited as 
                originating in France, the balisong is a knife with 2 handles that enclose the 
                blade when shut and hold it straight when open. It’s a very useful tool that can 
                be both opened and shut with 1 hand making it very convenient to work with. In modern 
                day, balisongs are used primarily as a sort of skill or stunt toy, with the primary 
                goal being to spin the knife around in interesting and complex ways. Mastery of momentum 
                and finger control is a large part of this hobby.

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Balisong is unfortunately not a super accessible hobby. These kinds of knives may not be legal 
                in many countries and states, and even in non-restrictive states they may be against city law. 
                The alternative to knives, called trainers, are non-sharpened replicas that allow you to 
                flip as a hobby without breaking the law or ever cutting yourself. While not in the spirit of the 
                hobby (in the same way that bmx bikers don’t sport training wheels) trainers are 
                an adequate way to practice and have fun. The most notable challenge with balisong as a 
                hobby is that manufacturers of balisongs are few, and thus there is an issue of demand and 
                availability. This means knives are difficult to get your hands on and often more 
                expensive than seems to be reasonable.

                <p>
                    I’ve been flipping balisongs since I was around 14 or so. 
                    Though there are far better flippers than me out there I’m 
                    happy where I’m at, and still enjoy learning new tricks every so often.

                    There are some really solid smaller communities for balisong. A couple 
                    facebook groups and subreddit as well as several smaller community sites 
                    produce a fairly close-knit community when it comes to dedicated flippers. 
                    Instagram is another available social media platform for balisong.

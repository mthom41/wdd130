      <p>
        This page is all about helping you find fun new things to do and learn! As a result of lots of personal experience, I’ve found a few things pretty important to me in a hobby and some things that aren’t as impactful. I’ve decided to, in brief, categorize a few of my current and hobbies in ways that can help you find something that you’re both interested in and able to do without hitting a roadblock somewhere far down the line. Best of luck, and enjoy!

      <h3>Origami</h3>
      <p>
        Origami is the ancient art of paper folding to create interesting new shapes and ideas. Thought to originate anciently from either China or Japan, Origami has both deep historical roots and impressive modern applications and advancements. Models range from pleasantly simple to mind-boggling and complex which provides an impressive range in which attracted hobbyists can begin learning. Simple models especially can be found as diagrams and instructions that can be followed at one’s leisure and own pace. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Origami has a very low barrier to entry. It’s very very cheap as well! The only thing you need to physically obtain is paper. Many books and videos are available online and at public libraries to help you move from beginner to advanced models. Origami can be done anywhere, anytime, and can be interrupted at pretty much any point in the folding process for you to go do important things or take whatever breaks you need.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        I became fascinated by origami as a child around 8 or 9 years old and have phased in and out of passion for it ever since. It’s always a fun hobby to come back to, and if you fold some models enough you can pull them out as a cool party trick or a small gift for someone on short notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some awesome communities for origamists including local clubs, a couple of facebook pages and subreddits, tags on instagram and a plethora of websites with detailed instructions from beginner to very advanced models.

      <h3>Balisong</h3>
      <p>
        Balisong is actually the name of a tool more commonly known as a butterfly knife. Cited often as appearing originally in the Philippines and occasionally cited as originating in France, the balisong is a knife with 2 handles that enclose the blade when shut and hold it straight when open. It’s a very useful tool that can be both opened and shut with 1 hand making it very convenient to work with. In modern day, balisongs are used primarily as a sort of skill or stunt toy, with the primary goal being to spin the knife around in interesting and complex ways. Mastery of momentum and finger control is a large part of this hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Balisong is unfortunately not a super accessible hobby. These kinds of knives are illegal in many countries and states, and even in non-restrictive states may be against city law. The alternative to knives, called trainers, are non-sharpened replicas that allow you to flip without breaking the law or ever cutting yourself. While not in the spirit of the hobby (in the same way that bmx bikers don’t still use training wheels) trainers are an adequate way to practice and have fun. The most notable problem with balisong as a hobby, though, is that manufacturers of balisongs are pretty limited by demand and availability. This means knives are difficult to get your hands on and often more expensive than seems to be reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been flipping balisongs since I was around 14 or so. Though there are far better flippers than me out there I’m happy where I’m at, and still enjoy learning new tricks every so often.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some really solid smaller communities for balisong. A couple facebook groups and subreddit as well as several smaller community sites produce a fairly close-knit community when it comes to dedicated flippers. Instagram is another available social media platform for balisong.

      <h3>Kendama</h3>
      <p>
        Kendama is a toy that many have seen or heard of but not nearly as many people have tried out. A simple ball-and-cup toy at first, over time the kendama has been tweaked to become yet another skill toy for beginners and enthusiasts alike to practice coordination and patience. Kendama enthusiasts now juggle, throw, spin, and precisely balance the ball and the ‘cup’ parts of the toy (called the ken) in all sorts of interesting and challenging ways. This hobby starts out simple and can become as easy or hard as you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kendama is an extremely accessible hobby! Kendamas are fairly cheap (starting around $20-25 for a decently nice one) and can last quite a long time, be dropped many times, etc. without needing to be replaced. It’s not dangerous or particularly tiring, but requires patience with yourself. It definitely takes time to master the hand-eye coordination to get the tricks you are working on to be consistent. Kendama is also a hobby you can pretty much take anywhere and isn’t too hard to just pick up to quell a few minutes of boredom between other activities. Playing kendama for a long period of time will really help your hand-eye coordination and make you feel like you have a real aptitude for catching things and other activities with quick reaction times.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began learning kendama during my mission and have casually enjoyed it ever since. Though I’m no prodigy, it’s always fun to learn something new and build consistency in tricks I’m trying to master.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are fantastic kendama communities out there! Plenty of people do meetups and ‘jams’ where everyone just gets together and plays for a while. The internet, of course, also has a fantastic variety of platforms to both view and post about kendamas.
